           <p style="color: black; text-align: 29px;padding-right: 25%;"> GOD Loves You...There is no greater love that
             anyone can experience that exceeds the love of GOD. "For GOD so loved the
              world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in
               him should not perish, but have everlasting life." (John 3:16)
            We Are Naturally Unrighteous...We have all been stained by sin. 
             There is no one who measures up to GOD's standard without the grace of salvation. 
             "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of GOD." (Romans 3:23) 
            There is a Need For Salvation...The penalty for sin is terrifying.  Sin is a 
            crime which is punishable by both spiritual and natural death.  "For the price
             of sin is death; but the gift of GOD is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
              LORD." (Romans 6:23)
            Salvation is available in Christ alone for He Paid the Price for our sin..."GOD 
            demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ
             died for us".  Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name 
             under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved." (Acts 4:12)
            Salvation Can Be Yours Today...Salvation is available through faith in the 
            good news of Christ, a repentant heart, baptism in the name Lord Jesus Christ,
             and reception of the Holy Spirit.  "What must I do to be saved?...Believe in 
             the LORD Jesus, and you will be saved." (Acts 16:30-31)  "Peter said to them,
              repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the 
              forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." 
              (Acts 2:38)</p>
